<h2 align="center">EUF PORTAL <br>An Application for Managing Environmental Users' Fee in Puerto Galera</h2>

> ### <h2>🔍BACKGROUND</h2>
- Puerto Galera issued Municipal Ordinance No. 06-03 to improve its environmental efforts, which established an Environmental Users' Fee System. The ordinance is based on multiple national policies, notably the 1987 Constitution (Section 5, Article X) and the 1991 Local Government Code, which empowers local governments to generate money. The EUF was established as a funding tool to promote sustainable tourism and reduce the negative impact of growing visitor activity on the municipality's coastal and marine resources. The EUF's revenue supports conservation projects, waste management, and environmental awareness programs.

> ### <h2>❗PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED</h2>
- While fees are collected on a regular basis, many tourists are unaware of how their contributions are used. ALso mismatch between the number of tourists and the actual fees collected, often caused by errors in classification like including exempted individuals such as PWDs in the regular tourist count. These inconsistencies lead to inaccurate reports and unreliable data, making it difficult for  the Tourism and Treasurer’s Offices to ensure transparency and proper tracking.

> ### <h2>💡PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
- Digitizing the current process of collecting and tallying fees through the development of a mobile application.
  
> ### <h2>🗂️PROJECT APPLICATION OVERVIEW</h2>
- EUF Portal is a cross-platform Flutter application designed for the efficient management of tourist transactions, staff administration, and analytics/reporting for the EUF (Ecological User Fee) system. The app supports both desktop and mobile layouts, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience for authorized personnel.

> ### <h2>🛠️DEVELOPMENT MODEL</h2>
- Plan - The team defined the project's main goal: to create a mobile app that fixes problems with manual environmental fee collection in Puerto Galera.
- Design - The team decided on the right software tools and created visual designs (wireframes and mock-ups) for the app.
- Development - This is where the team wrote the code to build the mobile application.
- Testing - Once the coding was done, the team thoroughly tested the app. This phase focused on finding and fixing any bugs, ensuring the code was clean, and confirming that the app worked exactly as required.
- Deployment - After successful testing, the mobile application will be released. This allows staff and tourists to start using the EUF Portal to manage and view environmental fee information.
- Review - In this ongoing phase, the team will watch for any issues or problems that come up after the app is launched. We will also gather user feedback to continuously improve the EUF Portal.
